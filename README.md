# SpatialEcology
WIP. A package for community- and macro-ecological analysis in julia. The backbone of the package is a port of the R package `nodiv` , available from CRAN.
The package offers types for keeping presence-absence matrices, phylogenies, site data and species traits together in an easily accessible format, that ensures that data is aligned for analysis. It includes functions for performing basic macroecological analyses, community phylogenetics and matrix null models. It also provides a set of Plots.jl recipes for convenient plotting.
